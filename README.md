For my STU team:

Runtime vscode env for node express
Just make sure you have npm, and node installed on computer (when installing node it auto installs npm).

Then to download expressjs modules run:

expressjs: npm install express --save

check if installed: npm list express

Feel free to contact me if any problems pop up
